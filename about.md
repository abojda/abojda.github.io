**Deep Learning / Computer Vision Engineer with background in robotics and embedded programming and (not so) short episode in space.**

Currently experimenting in topics revolving around **image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation**, but generally curious about CV and NLP.

In my previous role as a robotics software engineer, had the opportunity to work on exciting projects that involved:
- Designing and implementing **obstacle detection system** (lidar and stereo camera)
- Developing proof-of-concept for **2D/3D tomato detection and tracking system**
- Working on sensor fusion and robot localization stack

Former member of [Robotics Student Interest Group "KoNaR"](https://konar.pwr.edu.pl) at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology:
- Took part in numerous robotics projects, competitions and hackathons
- Most notably, participated (as software engineer) in ~1.5 years long project of developing robotics payload for [sounding rocket experiment](https://rexusbexus.net/)
- Project ended with [succesful rocket launch and nominal operation of our experiment](https://www.facebook.com/teamTRACZ/videos/614381855668227/)
