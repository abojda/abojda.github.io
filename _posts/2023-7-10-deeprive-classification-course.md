Some time ago, I enrolled in the [DeepDrive image classification training program [PL]](https://deepdrive.pl/klasyfikacja/) -- a great course covering a wide range of topics around image classification, including:
- Best practices for model training in PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning
- Transfer learning and finetuning
- Regularization and data augmentation techniques
- Working with an imbalanced dataset
- Interpretability and explainability
- Self-supervised learning
- Model optimization
- Model deployment


The course offered a fair dose of theoretical background, but the main focus was on practical aspects -- each chapter ended with a homework project. I worked through all these projects some time ago, but **only recently, I decided to slightly clean up the notebooks, review the results and make all the projects public.**

### Check them out on my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/abojda/deepdrive_course)

PS: If I had to choose only one project to explore, I would pick [chapter 08 -- interpretability analysis](https://github.com/abojda/deepdrive_course/tree/main/notebooks/08).
